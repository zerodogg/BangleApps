Service that allows you to use an app's back button using left to right swipe gesture.

## Settings

Mode: Blacklist/Whitelist/Always On/Disabled
App List: Black-/whitelisted apps
Standard # of swipe handlers: 0-10 (Default: 0, must be changed for backswipe to work at all)
Standard # of drag handlers: 0-10 (Default: 0, must be changed for backswipe to work at all)


Standard # of handlers settings are used to fine tune when backswipe should trigger the back function. E.g. when using a keyboard that works on drags, we don't want the backswipe to trigger when we just wanted to select a letter. This might not be able to cover all cases however.
