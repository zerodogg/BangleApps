# Binary LED Clock

A binary watch with LEDs, showing time and date.

From top to bottom the watch face shows four rows of leds:

* hours (red leds)
* minutes (green leds)
* day (yellow leds, top row)
* month (yellow leds, bottom row)

As usual, luminous leds represent a logical one, dark leds a logcal '0'.
Widgets aren't affected and are shown as normal.
