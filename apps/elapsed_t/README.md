# Elapsed Time Clock
A clock that calculates the time difference between now (in blue/cyan) and any given target date (in red/orange).

The results is show in years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds. To save battery life, the seconds are shown only when the watch is unlocked, or can be disabled entirely.

The time difference is positive if the target date is in the past and negative if it is in the future.
