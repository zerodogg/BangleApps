## How to use it
Make sure you have all the prerequisites from above.

The watch should automatically start displaying values, if there is an arrow visible behind the value, the value is within the not-expired-yet time range changeable in the settings standard is 15 minutes. (I will probably change this in the future, to strike through the text to make expired values clearer).

## Settings
In the settings, you can:
- Disable/hide the widget
- Change the unit from mmol/L to mg/dL
- Set a time at which old BG values expire
