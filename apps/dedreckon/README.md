# Ded Reckon

Dead Reckoning using compass and step counter.

This allows logging track using "dead reckoning" -- that's logging
angles from compass and distances from step counter. You need to mark
turns, and point watch to direction of the turn. Simultaneously, it
tries to log positions using GPS. You can use it to calibrate your
step length by comparing GPS and step counter data. It can also get
pretty accurate recording of track walked in right circumstances.

Tap bottom part of the screen to select display (text or map for
now). Point watch to new direction, then tap top left part of screen
to indicate a turn.

Map shows blue line for track from dead reckonging, and green line for
track from GPS.

You probably want magnav installed (and calibrated) for useful
results, as it provides library with better compass.
