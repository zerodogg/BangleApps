# Sleep Quiet

Set Quiet mode (or alarms only mode), when the sleep tracking app detects sleep (each 10 min evaluated)

## Usage

When activated, app disables all notifications / all except alarms when sleep detected. 

## Controls

In the app you can activate / deactivate the functionality and define if all notifications / all except alarms are to be silenced.

## Note
The app is based upon the [sleeplog](https://github.com/espruino/BangleApps/tree/master/apps/sleeplog) app.

It reuses the widget from [Quiet Mode Schedule and Widget](https://github.com/espruino/BangleApps/tree/master/apps/qmsched), as it does exactly what I needed, so why reinvent the wheel.

## ToDos
-further code clean up

-optimization of code (and check if needed)

-feedback is always welcome
