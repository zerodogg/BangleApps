# Sliding Text Clock - See the time in different languages

Inspired by the Pebble sliding clock, old times are scrolled off the screen and new times on. You are also able to change language on the fly so you can see the time written in other languages using button 1. Please use the upload page to choose which languages you want loaded.

## Usage

### Bangle 2

The Bangle 2 has Live Controls switched **off** by default so the colour and language have to be changed from the setting Menu.
Please locate the Sliding Text clock under the setting->apps menu.

With the Live Controls switched on:
#### Bottom right hand corner press
press the bottom right hand corner of the screen to change the colour

| White                | Black                | Gray                 | Red                  |
